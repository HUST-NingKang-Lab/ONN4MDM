## preprocessing update

1. extend attrbutes for SuperTree -> update livingTree package
2. dont calculate the order of nodes in for-loops or functions being called repeatedly
3. calculate attrbute and pass them to functions, dont let functions calculate itself
4. dont remove levels, this is extremely slow
5. pre-generate genus node ids and paths
